# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms_5th-Semester

In this diverse gruop of java and C# files, we can find a wide variety of methods that can be used to work with 
different data structures in order to allow lower and cleaner ways to work with large volumes of data. 
Across all of these files, we can find: 
* Sorting algorithms
* Searching algorithms
* Technics to store data efficiently across different data structures
* Graphs development
* Parallel programming fundamentals
